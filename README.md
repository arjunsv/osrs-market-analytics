OSRS Market Analytics and Price Prediction
===================

A page/tool for visualizing real time prices and quantities of tradeable items in the game Old School Runescape. In this popular online video game, there is a central exchange for items that players use to trade eachother. This active and dynamic data set is an interesting analog for real life markets and prices. 


I plan to use machine learning and other data interpretations in order to predict price increases and drops.
