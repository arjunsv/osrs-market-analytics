OSRS Market Analytics and Price Prediction
===================

A tool for visualizing real time prices and quantities of tradeable items in the game Old School Runescape. In this popular online video game, there is a central exchange for items that players use to trade eachother. This active and dynamic data set is an interesting analog for real life markets and prices. 


I plan to use machine learning and other data interpretations in order to predict price increases and drops.


Real Time Data Visualization

### Video Demo

This page allows users to select any item in OSRS and add it to the page. The charts on the page will display the current population of OSRS, the quantity traded of the selected items, and the prices of the selected items.

The CanvasJS graphs will automatically resize axes to accomadate the largest price or quantity of an item loaded into the charts.

Toggling the labels of the items above the graph will hide the data stream of that particular item and rescale the graph.


Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis to Predict Price Increases/Decreases
-------------
The goal of this part of the project is to use scikit-learn to classify a set of real time parameters of a specific item into groups based on how good of a purchase the item is based on on its predicted price increase in some time interval Âµ.
